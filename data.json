A second sweep checked the area around the wreckage of the enemy ships. Finally, satisfied that nothing awaited us, we eased over and checked for any still-operational or partly-destroyed busters.",

Not only can we not do the pairing-up thing to defend against the missiles, but we don't have enough busters to take out the missiles and the ships, even if our luck is perfect. So I'm going to try to rebuild some busters, and I'm going to scoop up a bunch of scrap from the battle as well, for rail gun ammo. You might want to do the same.\"",

          "I spared a millisecond to review the situation. I had five missiles coming in from the rear. I could take two out, possibly three, with the rail gun. Homer had eight missiles coming in from the front. That meant thirteen missiles against eleven busters, to say nothing of the Brazilian ships which we would still need to deal with. It was very likely that the Brazilians had used everything they had by this point. We were far too close to them for any further missile play.",

It appeared to have damaged but not obliterated Heaven-6. However, the ship was adrift with everything offline. A couple of busters had circled around and chased the two final missiles from the front, but only one was anywhere near close enough to do any good.",
          "I did a quick inventory. I had two busters left. And two enemies. There was no time to deal with Homer at the moment. I called the busters home and did a full ping, trying to locate the Brazilian ships.",

          "My roamers sent back detailed views as they investigated Heaven-6. Homer appeared to have been very lucky. A fluke piece of shrapnel had cut off power to his computer core. Though there was significant structural damage, the actual core systems were intact. The reactor had been able to effect a graceful emergency shutdown when control disappeared.",
          "Pfft. Homer's roamers. Jeez, I'm starting to sound like him. It occurred to me that I could now decorate my hull as Bob-1 had. Three for me, three for Homer. Better make that a priority.",

          "Homer waved a hand in a vague out there gesture. \"So, what do we have?\"",
          "Homer bobbed his head, and I continued, \"The signs of war are everywhere. Nukes were definitely used, both planetside and spaceside, and I mean a lot! It looks like everyone just went toe to toe and started throwing punches, until only one side was left standing. As far as I can tell, the only technological force left in the whole system was a small group of Brazilian probes that had been modified for war. I found the manufacturing area \u2014 it had broken down, and the Ara\u00fajos couldn't repair it because they hadn't been loaded with the autofactory software or equipment. They couldn't land and bring someone upstairs to fix it \u2014 not that I'm sure there's anyone left to do it anyway \u2014 and they couldn't build a lander or shuttle, because no autofactory. Classic catch-22.\"",

But then, you wouldn't expect anyone to want to attract attention. I'm sure the Ara\u00fajo gang dropped a rock on anyone they detected. By now everyone still alive has gone to ground.\"",

I guess we could transmit an announcement, but some might just see that as a trick.\" He idly poked a finger at his copy of the globe and spun it to show different views. He sat back after a few seconds, then put his hand to his chin and resumed staring into space.",

As they were produced, the cargo drones would start moving materials to the L4 and L5 points in the Earth/Moon system. Larger autofactories were already being set up at the two Lagrange points, initially to produce Bobs and drones, and then to bootstrap up to the industrial-scale equipment necessary to build a full-sized colony ship."

While his peers were sitting around in the shade or engaged in games of tag, Archimedes walked around, picking up rocks and attempting to break them. I think he was looking for more rocks that made sharp edges, like the flint he'd made into a tool for his mother. There didn't appear to be any flint in the area, so the tools were at a premium. It made me wonder where the flint had come from, though. I set an explorer drone the task of finding the nearest exposed flint deposits.",

I didn't see anyone else in any of the tribes doing this, so I had to assume it was unique behavior.",

It was obvious to me that he was investigating and cataloguing his world. He would have gotten no help from his parents \u2014 they and everyone else seemed to be in the pointy-stick stage and quite satisfied with that. They weren't even straightening the sticks, so the things couldn't really be called spears.",

Before he'd even struck the first blow, several adult Deltans had come over. There was a loud exchange, and one of the adults tried to grab the nodule.

          "The trading frenzy was over, and people had left with flints of various sizes. Archimedes' mother was going over the spoils. She had an expression involving wide eyes and erect ears that I tentatively identified as a smile-analogue. Looks like they'll be eating well for a few days.",
          "Archimedes had a haul of his own. He'd gotten several pointy sticks, a flint knife that had lost its edge, and all the flint flakes that were too small to be usable. Most importantly, the elder had shown him how to knap the flint.",
          "Archimedes spent most of the rest of the day trying to put a new edge on the flint knife he'd received in trade. From the look of it, he didn't do a half-bad job. The kid was a quick learner, for sure. He took his prize to the elder, who I decided to name Moses for no good reason that I could think of. Moses looked at the result and nodded in approval. Okay, he actually did kind of a circle thing with his head, but it had the same meaning. He spent an hour showing Archimedes how to get the last bits sharpened.",
          "The next day, Archimedes snuck out to his stash and pulled out one of the other flint nodules. He had the knapping tools that the elder had given him. He turned the nodule over and examined it for almost a half hour without actually doing anything with it. It was pretty obvious that he had something in mind and didn't want to screw it up. I watched with great interest, and I sensed Marvin watching over my shoulder, VR-wise.",
          "Finally, Archimedes got to work. It took maybe ten minutes before we could see what he was trying for. He had split the nodule left of center, then right of center on the bigger half. He was trying to extract the biggest flake he could. I decided he was probably going for a hand-axe.",
          "Over the next several hours, Archimedes slowly and deliberately converted the large core into a quite workable hand axe. He then cleaned up his area, carefully hiding all the useful flint pieces in his stash, and headed off with his new tool.",
          "While cutting the third sapling, Archimedes had a misfire and attempted to chop the tree with his hand instead of the axe. The hopping around and verbalizations were really very human-looking, and to my shame I laughed a little. Afterward, Archimedes kicked the tree and said something monosyllabic. I marked that as an F-Bomb-analogue, and I don't mean maybe.",
          "Archimedes finished cutting down the third sapling, but I could see that his heart wasn't in it. His swings were tentative, and he hesitated on each one. As soon as he had it down, he took the three saplings back to his work area, set them down, and went back to camp.",
          "The first attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful \u2014 the axe acted like one of those tennis ball launchers you buy to throw a ball for your dog, with the axe blade playing the part of the tennis ball. Archimedes threw the now-empty stick down, reinforced my conclusion about the F-Bomb-analogue, and stomped off to look for his blade.",
          "Archimedes had found the tennis ball, er, hand axe, and was reattaching it to the stick, grumbling away in Deltan. I carefully catalogued the monologue. Very likely there were a lot of scatological and sexual references in there, and learning to swear in any language is always interesting.",
          "His second attempt was better, in that the axe blade didn't take off for parts unknown. But the stick had been intended for a spear, well, a pointy stick, and was too thin to serve as an axe handle. It bounced, rebounded, and twisted in his hand with every swing. Muttering darkly, Archimedes lay down the hand axe and stalked off.",
          "He came back in a few minutes with a more robust handle, sat down, and went through the whole mounting sequence. This time, when he tried it, the axe produced a very gratifying thunk, and wood chips flew. Archimedes gave a whoop that needed no translation and finished cutting down the sapling.",
          "In any case, Archimedes' return to the camp caused a near-riot. Interestingly, Archimedes took a couple of token items in exchange, but mostly just gave away the pointy sticks to the biggest Deltans. This not only placed them in his debt but also ensured that the gorilloids would be given the warmest welcome possible on their next visit.",
          "I jumped a little. I'd been so wrapped up in what Archimedes was doing that I'd forgotten all about Marvin.",
          "Meanwhile, Archimedes had risen significantly in stature. He and his mother were now closer to the campfire, and the other juveniles were deferring to him. In fact, since Archimedes seemed to be pretty close to puberty, from what I could tell, some of the female juveniles were giving him a whole lot of attention. Way to go, kid.",
          "Then came the day I'd been both looking forward to and dreading. Another gorilloid attack. By now, Archimedes had armed everyone with the good pointy sticks, and the improved hunting prospects meant more adult males stayed home to guard.",
          "Archimedes was fascinated by the story as well. Any time he saw or heard a retelling, he would run over to join the audience. Like many of the Deltans, he began to experiment with this technological innovation. The Deltans already understood throwing, but it seemed they'd never considered applying it to anything other than rocks. It was getting quite dangerous around the camp, until some of the elders put their collective foot down. After much yelling and gesturing, the experimenters took their sticks outside the camp to practice.",
          "Archimedes wasn't having any better luck with his spear-chucking, but unlike the others, he took his pointy stick, sat down, and stared at it.",
          "It only took a few hours for Archimedes to find a flake about the right size, split the end of the pointy stick, and tie the flake onto it. The difference in weight wasn't much, but it moved the center of gravity forward of the grip point. That was all that was needed. The next time Archimedes threw the stick, it embedded itself in the ground in a most satisfactory manner. The other experimenters watched as Archimedes repeated the result twice more.",
          "After the third toss, one of the adults grabbed the spear and examined it. This resulted in another raucous town hall meeting. After Archimedes got his spear back, there was some further discussion. Then Archimedes headed off toward his cache with half the encampment following him. By this point, I was grinning like a fool. You go, boy!",
          "There was a lot more gabbling when Archimedes brought out his two remaining flint nodules. I think some people were angry with him for holding out. There was some pushing and shoving, and I readied the drone to bash some heads if necessary. We hadn't deployed the buster drones yet, but I was quite prepared to sacrifice one of the light-duty units. I was certain that it would only take one to clear the room.",
          "Fortunately, it wasn't necessary. The Deltans that Archimedes had given the first, good pointy sticks to \u2014 the largest members of the tribe \u2014 were firmly on his side, and the others seemed understandably reluctant to challenge them.",
          "To the extent I was able to follow the discussion, it sounded like Archimedes would volunteer his nodules to make spear points for everyone, and in return he would get part of every kill from then on. Moses said something in an angry tone, and the agreement was amended to include him. I'm positive that I heard a comment to the effect that that wouldn't be for long anyway. Moses looked offended but seemed otherwise satisfied. He and Archimedes set to work on the nodules, with half the camp watching."

          "\"What are we going to do, though? Set up armed drones around the perimeter? Become some kind of sky god that protects them?\" Marvin looked from one person to the next, waiting for an answer.",

And interestingly, there's some worked flint there and in a couple of villages nearby. I think at least some of the Deltans have known what to do with it, so Archimedes isn't unique.\" Marvin looked around at us to make sure we would get his next comment. \"I think there's a recessive gene for increased intelligence that's spreading through the population. It just needs the opportunity to be expressed, in every sense of the word.\"",
          "\"I've got something for you,\" Marvin said, interrupting my thoughts. I looked up at the schematic floating in my holotank. It showed plans for an observation drone that had been reinforced internally and given twenty-pound steel caps at each end \u2014 a sort of personnel-buster. Even with the modest acceleration capabilities of the drones, they could probably deliver a punch equivalent to a cannonball. Whether the drone would survive was an unknown.",

After a few moments, Archimedes headed off at an angle toward an outcropping that was one of his favorite hangouts.

Archimedes moved the tool a fraction to the left and his ears curled with concentration as he again tapped on the tool.",
          "The other Deltan adolescent, whom I'd named Richard, watched Archimedes then tried to copy his technique. But the tool slipped off the cobble and stabbed into his foot. He leaped up and hopped on the other foot, cursing with enthusiasm.",
          "After a few moments, Richard noticed Archimedes' grin and scowled. Snarling, he compared Archimedes to pigoid droppings, then stalked off, limping.",
          "Moses and Archimedes were the tribe's best flint experts and tool-makers. And based on Richard's performance, still the only ones. Archimedes was a teenager by Deltan standards \u2014 past puberty, but not yet fully grown. He was, however, easily the most intelligent Deltan in the village.

A couple of juveniles, like Richard, had shown some interest, but couldn't maintain the level of concentration required to complete a tool. Very likely Archimedes would have to wait for some of his own progeny before he'd be able to attract any apprentices of his own.",
          "I mentioned my theory about potential apprentices, and Marvin laughed. \"I can think of at least two females from Archimedes' cohort who are actively working on that.\"",
          "Yeah, gotta love adolescence. Between his flint-knapping skills, his tool-making ability in general, and his position as primary spokesperson for The Bawbe, Archimedes had a level of mojo totally out of keeping with his youth. All of which apparently went over quite well with the girls.",
          "Archimedes set aside the core and the tools, stood up, and stretched. He and Moses exchanged a few words, and Moses got up and wandered off. There was no nine-to-five in Deltan society. Things got done when things got done. It looked like they'd had enough for the moment.",
          "Archimedes turned and looked around until he located the drone I was using to observe. He grinned up at me and made a head motion toward the practice range. I bobbed the drone in agreement, then floated after him as he headed in that direction.",
          "Archimedes nodded. He walked in silence for a few more moments. \"Arnold is happy with the new village, uh, Camelot?\" I had mentioned my name for the camp once, without running it through the translator. Archimedes was trying to render the word phonetically. It was a valiant attempt, but no human would have recognized the sound.",
          "\"Let's just go with your word for it, Archimedes. My language doesn't translate well into Deltan.\"",
          "Archimedes shrugged. \"The gorilloids are a problem. They are always hungry. And there are so many on this side of the mountains. Guarding is a bigger job when people are away from the village.\"",
          "Archimedes was exceptionally good with a spear, but he lacked the upper-body strength to get any kind of distance. When he reached full adulthood, though, he would be formidable.",
          "\"How is it going with the medicine woman?\" Archimedes asked, interrupting my train of thought.",
          "Archimedes grinned up at the drone. \"Welcome to my tribe. Maybe you should use one of the flying rocks on her.\"",
          "I laughed, not only at the comment, but at the fact that Archimedes was sounding so much like me. He'd picked up the concept of dry humor right away, but it was completely beyond any but maybe a half-dozen other Deltans.",
          "Archimedes shrugged. He'd been dealing with that level of conservatism his whole life. It was a constant source of amusement to him that I was surprised by the attitude.",
          "We endured a few moments of staring as Archimedes came over the crest, the football-sized drone hovering by his shoulder. But I was old news, and the kids soon went back to what they were doing. They appeared to be playing Rinjhaxa, a sort of pick-up-sticks with betting. Again, I was struck by how very human-like these people were. We only had two data points as of yet, but I wondered if there was some universality about the way intelligent species developed and behaved.",
          "Archimedes waved at Diana, who sat with some of her friends. She smiled and waved back, then glared at the drone and turned away. Not my number one fan, for sure. I'd never given her any reason to hate me, as far as I knew. It might be as simple as competition for Archimedes' attention.",
          "Archimedes sat down, facing north-east towards the mountain range that split this section of the continent. I brought the drone down to a comfortable talking height and took a moment to enjoy the view.",
          "Archimedes gestured towards the mountains in the distance. Most of them were high enough to have snow year-round. \"That's a big journey. It was hard with you leading us back here, when we knew what we were heading for. It must have been harder when our parents and their parents were going the other way and had no idea what they'd find.\"",
          "He looked around at the village, spread below us on the mesa. \"It's so much better here. Except for all the gorilloids, of course.\" Archimedes showed his teeth, which I automatically translated to a frown.",
          "\"That's good, Archimedes. I want to see your people succeed. I don't know if there are a lot of intelligent species in all the worlds of the sky, but each one is priceless. So far, my brothers haven't found any others.\"",
          "I smiled at the question, but Archimedes couldn't see that. \"I don't really know. I made four others before I left the last star, but they will hopefully have made more. I've made three here, so far. Two have left, and Marvin is still here, helping me.\"",
          "\"It's complicated, Archimedes. I'm not flesh and blood, like you. Each brother I make is a copy of me, with my memories and everything. But usually a little different in personality. Marvin is more cautious than me and tends to keep me from implementing wild plans.\"",
          "Archimedes stared at the drone for a few more seconds, then looked away. \"Questions just bring more questions, and I never catch up. I should stick to things that affect my people.\"",
          "I laughed, which the translation routine converted into the Deltan expression of humor. \"That's fine, Archimedes. I have a very similar problem. I call it a TODO list. It only ever seems to get bigger.\"",

She intensely disliked the drones and wouldn't hang around anywhere near us when I was with Archimedes. An obvious symptom of low intelligence, in my books.",
          "I looked up from the observation window. The mating season was almost done. Most pairings had been decided by this point, but some Deltans hadn't gotten the memo. You could tell when that happened, because the miscreant would find himself (and sometimes herself) being beaten on by both members of the pairing on which he or she was trying to intrude. That was usually enough to make the point, but there were three or four individuals left who couldn't seem to take get lost for an answer. Archimedes and Diana had formalized their mating without further challenge, so it was purely scientific interest on my part.",

Obviously volcanic in origin, it was steep, deeply folded, and very probably had a lot of lava tubes that would make perfect homes for large flying things.",

They spend most of their down-time basking on the beach, and they hunt in the water. They're a little more mobile than seals or sea-lions, but still basically sitting ducks on land. Although I'd imagine they could do some damage with those tusks.\"",

          "I sat down, called up coffee, and leaned back in thought. \"I think we can agree that just doing nothing is off the table?\" Marvin nodded and I continued, \"Likewise, asking the Deltans to move again is probably a non-starter. I doubt they'd do it even if I had a good, safe destination in mind.\"",

In a society where very little changed from generation to generation, it was easy to think of The Way Things Are as some kind of natural state. But Archimedes had seen enough new knowledge in his lifetime to understand that when you went from not knowing something to knowing something, it changed the way you lived.",
          "With the loss of that awe had come a much deeper friendship, and a better understanding between us. Archimedes thought a lot of the things humans took for granted were hilarious. Like the idea of rules for everything. Deltans simply wouldn't stand for such regimentation of their lives.",
          "As we walked across the land bridge, I looked ahead at the village proper. It was a sea of Deltans, in groups around the central fires, and smaller groups around individual fire-pits. I could see Archimedes' point. No one would be able to keep track of this many people. Really, based on the old definition of a village where everyone knew everyone else, this could be thought of as an unhealthy development. Caerleon wasn't much better. I wondered if the Deltans had a higher tolerance for crowding, or if they had developed a reluctance to split off villages because of the gorilloid and hippogriff threats. I resolved to bring it up with Archimedes when time permitted.",

          "We sat down at the fire, and Archimedes introduced me to the adults using a common Deltan name, which I instructed the translation routine to render as Robert. I performed the proper ear-waggle greeting to each. Diana didn't even twitch, and I relaxed.",
          "I noted that Diana was looking old and frail. It confirmed my feeling that Archimedes was aging more slowly than average. Probably the same gene responsible for his increased intelligence was affecting his lifespan. I felt a moment of relief that she might be gone soon, then a spike of shame at the thought. I might not like her, but she was Archimedes' life mate, and he was my friend."
