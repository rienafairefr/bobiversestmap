But if I never come in closer than the Kuiper belt, I should still be able to pick up radio traffic. Or, I could spend some time getting prepared, then mount a better expedition. I think Bill mentioned working in pairs. Milo, want to take a trip?\"",

          "Riker, meanwhile, looked like he was about to explode. I quickly changed the subject. \"One other thing. I was pretty pissed to realize that I couldn't do anything but an orbital survey of EE-2, er, Ragnar\u00f6k. I'd like to have landers of some kind for close examination of candidate planets. We can all think on this but maybe Bill can make it a research project while he works in-system.\"",

          "\"No, I guess not. I'm kind of ambivalent, myself, about going back. I think it's the way Riker and Milo seemed to immediately butt heads that's got me a little weirded out.\" I flashed a quick smile. \"And Mario, well, he makes Guppy look like a social butterfly. Creepy.\""

          "The multiple explosions saturated the video view and created a chaotic soup for radar and SUDDAR. During that brief interval of relative blindness, Homer and I fired eight cannonballs at full power.", 
          "\"Checkmate!\" Homer yelled. Intent on the approaching busters, the Brazilians had failed to detect the cannonballs. Totally inert, with no radio or fusion signature, the cannonballs were invisible unless the Brazilians picked that specific moment to do a SUDDAR sweep.", 
          "Homer and I did omnidirectional SUDDAR sweeps, looking for any tricks or traps that the Brazilians might have unloaded before they were destroyed. A second sweep checked the area around the wreckage of the enemy ships. Finally, satisfied that nothing awaited us, we eased over and checked for any still-operational or partly-destroyed busters.", 
          "Homer thought this was funny. \"Going to give them a proper burial?\"", 
          "Homer chortled like a kid who had just made a potty joke. \"Balls of solid steel\u2026\" He snorted.", 
          "I sighed, and the words friendly fire flashed through my mind. \"Homer, we've got six busters left, and the two Brazilians have four missiles each if they're provisioned the same as the four we just destroyed. Not only can we not do the pairing-up thing to defend against the missiles, but we don't have enough busters to take out the missiles and the ships, even if our luck is perfect. So I'm going to try to rebuild some busters, and I'm going to scoop up a bunch of scrap from the battle as well, for rail gun ammo. You might want to do the same.\"", 
          "Homer looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded.", 
          "Homer popped up in a video window. \"I see you survived the trip.\"", 
          "\"If we're that close, we can use rail guns,\" Homer said.", 
          "When we were still five minutes away from the lead asteroid, we received a hail from one of the Brazilian ships. I put the call up on the holotank, while Homer observed.", 
          "I looked at Homer in surprise. That's not Major Medeiros. Who is that?", 
          "Homer and I exchanged looks. After a pause, Homer said, \"So, what do you think is going on?\"", 
          "Homer cocked his head. \"Which might mean they didn't have time to give this guy a lot of training in being a replicant. And these ships may be all that's left of the war.\"", 
          "\"Damn. Exactly what we hoped they wouldn't do,\" Homer said. \"Guess they aren't that inexperienced.\"", 
          "\"Watch forward, while I take out the rest of this batch,\" I said to Homer.", 
          "As I as preparing my busters for launch, Homer said, \"Launches from up front. Looks like they had more missiles. I think we're screwed.\"", 
          "I spared a millisecond to review the situation. I had five missiles coming in from the rear. I could take two out, possibly three, with the rail gun. Homer had eight missiles coming in from the front. That meant thirteen missiles against eleven busters, to say nothing of the Brazilian ships which we would still need to deal with. It was very likely that the Brazilians had used everything they had by this point. We were far too close to them for any further missile play.", 
          "\"We have to cut the numbers of the frontal attack. I'll give you all my busters, save two. Try to knock as many out with shrapnel as you can.\" I launched all my busters and handed control of five over to Homer, who sent them forward.", 
          "\"They're getting a little close,\" Homer said. \"Little help, any time\u2026\"", 
          "As I sent a huge wave of shrapnel at the final missile, Homer yelped, \"Crap!\" and his signal went dead.", 
          "I split my attention between my one missile and Homer's battlefield. Homer had taken out almost all of his missiles, but one had exploded far too close. It appeared to have damaged but not obliterated Heaven-6. However, the ship was adrift with everything offline. A couple of busters had circled around and chased the two final missiles from the front, but only one was anywhere near close enough to do any good.", 
          "I did a quick inventory. I had two busters left. And two enemies. There was no time to deal with Homer at the moment. I called the busters home and did a full ping, trying to locate the Brazilian ships.", 
          "That's for Homer.", 
          "My roamers sent back detailed views as they investigated Heaven-6. Homer appeared to have been very lucky. A fluke piece of shrapnel had cut off power to his computer core. Though there was significant structural damage, the actual core systems were intact. The reactor had been able to effect a graceful emergency shutdown when control disappeared.", 
          "Pfft. Homer's roamers. Jeez, I'm starting to sound like him. It occurred to me that I could now decorate my hull as Bob-1 had. Three for me, three for Homer. Better make that a priority.", 
          "Homer steepled his fingers in a properly evil mastermindish pose. \"All their base are belong to us.\"", 
          "We laughed together, maybe the first time since Homer had been born that we'd been in sync like that. I had a sudden jolt of what might be described as fatherly pride. Okay, that's weird. Snap out of it!", 
          "Homer waved a hand in a vague out there gesture. \"So, what do we have?\"", 
          "Homer bobbed his head, and I continued, \"The signs of war are everywhere. Nukes were definitely used, both planetside and spaceside, and I mean a lot! It looks like everyone just went toe to toe and started throwing punches, until only one side was left standing. As far as I can tell, the only technological force left in the whole system was a small group of Brazilian probes that had been modified for war. I found the manufacturing area \u2014 it had broken down, and the Ara\u00fajos couldn't repair it because they hadn't been loaded with the autofactory software or equipment. They couldn't land and bring someone upstairs to fix it \u2014 not that I'm sure there's anyone left to do it anyway \u2014 and they couldn't build a lander or shuttle, because no autofactory. Classic catch-22.\"", 
          "\"So they were doing what? Running around smashing things instead?\" Homer grimaced.", 
          "I put a globe of the Earth up in the holotank, and sent a copy to Homer. \"I haven't been able to pick up any radio transmissions or reactor signatures. But then, you wouldn't expect anyone to want to attract attention. I'm sure the Ara\u00fajo gang dropped a rock on anyone they detected. By now everyone still alive has gone to ground.\"", 
          "Homer rubbed his forehead, his eyes unfocused. \"What'll we do? I guess we could transmit an announcement, but some might just see that as a trick.\" He idly poked a finger at his copy of the globe and spun it to show different views. He sat back after a few seconds, then put his hand to his chin and resumed staring into space.", 
          "\"I don't know, Homer.\" I shook my head, reluctant to meet his gaze. \"We're going to have to take this one step at a time.\"",

And interestingly, there's some worked flint there and in a couple of villages nearby. I think at least some of the Deltans have known what to do with it, so Archimedes isn't unique.\" Marvin looked around at us to make sure we would get his next comment. \"I think there's a recessive gene for increased intelligence that's spreading through the population.

He wandered like any normal kid and was just as likely to walk in circles or sit on a rock for half a day, playing with something.", 
          "As soon as Archimedes saw the nodules, he jumped forward and picked them up. He then put them down, did a little jig, and searched the immediate area for any more. When he was satisfied that he had found all there were to find, he came back, grabbed them, and headed back toward his camp.", 
          "He got maybe fifty feet, then stopped and looked down at his load. Marvin and I glanced at each other, perplexed. After a few moments, Archimedes headed off at an angle toward an outcropping that was one of his favorite hangouts. Once there, he hid all of the nodules except one in a crevice, then covered it with dead branches.", 
          "Taking a single flint nodule, Archimedes walked back to camp, and took a circuitous route to get to his mother. When he arrived, he set up with a couple of rocks to try to split the flint. We chuckled at the deliberate, studied casualness that he was trying to affect. It was so overdone that he might as well have been wearing a hat with a flashing red light. Before he'd even struck the first blow, several adult Deltans had come over. There was a loud exchange, and one of the adults tried to grab the nodule. Archimedes' mother jumped in, and the discussion got heated. Within seconds, a dozen or so Deltans were involved. At least half of them were yelling at any time, and pointy sticks were being waved. However, the floor seemed to be about evenly divided between those who wanted to take the nodule and those who suggested it would be over someone's dead body. Archimedes huddled at his mother's feet, while she showed her teeth to anyone who got too close.", 
          "The elder unwrapped some tools from a leather skin, sat with Archimedes, and patiently showed him how to split the flint. Now that was interesting. There was existing flint technology that hadn't been lost. This contraction of Deltan populations had to have been quick and recent.", 
          "Many of the Deltans who had been involved in the yelling match went running off. They soon came back with items such as extra pointy sticks, dead animals and chunks of meat, something that looked like some kind of tuber, and other less identifiable things. With a start, I realized they were prepared to trade for the flint. I put both hands to my face and started to laugh. We'd just made Archimedes rich.", 
          "The trading frenzy was over, and people had left with flints of various sizes. Archimedes' mother was going over the spoils. She had an expression involving wide eyes and erect ears that I tentatively identified as a smile-analogue. Looks like they'll be eating well for a few days.", 
          "Archimedes had a haul of his own. He'd gotten several pointy sticks, a flint knife that had lost its edge, and all the flint flakes that were too small to be usable. Most importantly, the elder had shown him how to knap the flint.", 
          "Archimedes spent most of the rest of the day trying to put a new edge on the flint knife he'd received in trade. From the look of it, he didn't do a half-bad job. The kid was a quick learner, for sure. He took his prize to the elder, who I decided to name Moses for no good reason that I could think of. Moses looked at the result and nodded in approval. Okay, he actually did kind of a circle thing with his head, but it had the same meaning. He spent an hour showing Archimedes how to get the last bits sharpened.", 
          "The next day, Archimedes snuck out to his stash and pulled out one of the other flint nodules. He had the knapping tools that the elder had given him. He turned the nodule over and examined it for almost a half hour without actually doing anything with it. It was pretty obvious that he had something in mind and didn't want to screw it up. I watched with great interest, and I sensed Marvin watching over my shoulder, VR-wise.", 
          "Finally, Archimedes got to work. It took maybe ten minutes before we could see what he was trying for. He had split the nodule left of center, then right of center on the bigger half. He was trying to extract the biggest flake he could. I decided he was probably going for a hand-axe.", 
          "Over the next several hours, Archimedes slowly and deliberately converted the large core into a quite workable hand axe. He then cleaned up his area, carefully hiding all the useful flint pieces in his stash, and headed off with his new tool.", 
          "While cutting the third sapling, Archimedes had a misfire and attempted to chop the tree with his hand instead of the axe. The hopping around and verbalizations were really very human-looking, and to my shame I laughed a little. Afterward, Archimedes kicked the tree and said something monosyllabic. I marked that as an F-Bomb-analogue, and I don't mean maybe.", 
          "Archimedes finished cutting down the third sapling, but I could see that his heart wasn't in it. His swings were tentative, and he hesitated on each one. As soon as he had it down, he took the three saplings back to his work area, set them down, and went back to camp.", 
          "The first attempt was spectacularly unsuccessful \u2014 the axe acted like one of those tennis ball launchers you buy to throw a ball for your dog, with the axe blade playing the part of the tennis ball. Archimedes threw the now-empty stick down, reinforced my conclusion about the F-Bomb-analogue, and stomped off to look for his blade.", 
          "Archimedes had found the tennis ball, er, hand axe, and was reattaching it to the stick, grumbling away in Deltan. I carefully catalogued the monologue. Very likely there were a lot of scatological and sexual references in there, and learning to swear in any language is always interesting.", 
          "His second attempt was better, in that the axe blade didn't take off for parts unknown. But the stick had been intended for a spear, well, a pointy stick, and was too thin to serve as an axe handle. It bounced, rebounded, and twisted in his hand with every swing. Muttering darkly, Archimedes lay down the hand axe and stalked off.", 
          "He came back in a few minutes with a more robust handle, sat down, and went through the whole mounting sequence. This time, when he tried it, the axe produced a very gratifying thunk, and wood chips flew. Archimedes gave a whoop that needed no translation and finished cutting down the sapling.", 
          "In any case, Archimedes' return to the camp caused a near-riot. Interestingly, Archimedes took a couple of token items in exchange, but mostly just gave away the pointy sticks to the biggest Deltans. This not only placed them in his debt but also ensured that the gorilloids would be given the warmest welcome possible on their next visit.", 
          "I jumped a little. I'd been so wrapped up in what Archimedes was doing that I'd forgotten all about Marvin.", 
          "Meanwhile, Archimedes had risen significantly in stature. He and his mother were now closer to the campfire, and the other juveniles were deferring to him. In fact, since Archimedes seemed to be pretty close to puberty, from what I could tell, some of the female juveniles were giving him a whole lot of attention. Way to go, kid.", 
          "Then came the day I'd been both looking forward to and dreading. Another gorilloid attack. By now, Archimedes had armed everyone with the good pointy sticks, and the improved hunting prospects meant more adult males stayed home to guard.", 
          "Archimedes was fascinated by the story as well. Any time he saw or heard a retelling, he would run over to join the audience. Like many of the Deltans, he began to experiment with this technological innovation. The Deltans already understood throwing, but it seemed they'd never considered applying it to anything other than rocks. It was getting quite dangerous around the camp, until some of the elders put their collective foot down. After much yelling and gesturing, the experimenters took their sticks outside the camp to practice.", 
          "Archimedes wasn't having any better luck with his spear-chucking, but unlike the others, he took his pointy stick, sat down, and stared at it.", 
          "It only took a few hours for Archimedes to find a flake about the right size, split the end of the pointy stick, and tie the flake onto it. The difference in weight wasn't much, but it moved the center of gravity forward of the grip point. That was all that was needed. The next time Archimedes threw the stick, it embedded itself in the ground in a most satisfactory manner. The other experimenters watched as Archimedes repeated the result twice more.", 
          "After the third toss, one of the adults grabbed the spear and examined it. This resulted in another raucous town hall meeting. After Archimedes got his spear back, there was some further discussion. Then Archimedes headed off toward his cache with half the encampment following him. By this point, I was grinning like a fool. You go, boy!", 
          "There was a lot more gabbling when Archimedes brought out his two remaining flint nodules. I think some people were angry with him for holding out. There was some pushing and shoving, and I readied the drone to bash some heads if necessary. We hadn't deployed the buster drones yet, but I was quite prepared to sacrifice one of the light-duty units. I was certain that it would only take one to clear the room.", 
          "Fortunately, it wasn't necessary. The Deltans that Archimedes had given the first, good pointy sticks to \u2014 the largest members of the tribe \u2014 were firmly on his side, and the others seemed understandably reluctant to challenge them.", 
          "To the extent I was able to follow the discussion, it sounded like Archimedes would volunteer his nodules to make spear points for everyone, and in return he would get part of every kill from then on. Moses said something in an angry tone, and the agreement was amended to include him. I'm positive that I heard a comment to the effect that that wouldn't be for long anyway. Moses looked offended but seemed otherwise satisfied. He and Archimedes set to work on the nodules, with half the camp watching."

And interestingly, there's some worked flint there and in a couple of villages nearby. I think at least some of the Deltans have known what to do with it, so Archimedes isn't unique.\" Marvin looked around at us to make sure we would get his next comment. \"I think there's a recessive gene for increased intelligence that's spreading through the population. It just needs the opportunity to be expressed, in every sense of the word.\"", 
          "\"I've got something for you,\" Marvin said, interrupting my thoughts. I looked up at the schematic floating in my holotank. It showed plans for an observation drone that had been reinforced internally and given twenty-pound steel caps at each end \u2014 a sort of personnel-buster. Even with the modest acceleration capabilities of the drones, they could probably deliver a punch equivalent to a cannonball. Whether the drone would survive was an unknown.",

After a few moments, Archimedes headed off at an angle toward an outcropping that was one of his favorite hangouts. Once there, he hid all of the nodules except one in a crevice, then covered it with dead branches.",

He turned the nodule over and examined it for almost a half hour without actually doing anything with it. It was pretty obvious that he had something in mind and didn't want to screw it up.
