Marvin, who had been watching over my shoulder, gave me a strange look, but I didn't feel the need to explain. Hell, he should be able to remember Original Bob going hunting with Dad, way back when. I shrugged at him without comment. Work it out, dude.", 
          "Marvin rolled his eyes and returned to the La-Z-Boy that he always materialized when he was visiting my VR. I spared a moment to let Jeeves refresh my coffee. As in every virtual reality space that implemented the Jeeves A.I., he resembled John Cleese in tux and tails.", 
          "All in VR, of course. Physically, Marvin and I were a couple of glowing opto-electronic cubes, installed in the two spaceships currently orbiting Delta Eridani 4. But we had been human once, and our VR environments kept us sane.", 
          "Spike came walking across my desk, meowed once, and plunked down on my keyboard. I accepted a coffee refill from Jeeves, then turned to Marvin. \"Okay. Excitement's over. What's up? You wanted to talk to me about something?\"", 
          "Marvin nodded and stood. He dismissed the La-Z-Boy and walked over to my work desk. Pulling up a wingback, he invoked a globe of Eden in mid-air over the desk, with a small section of one continent outlined in red. \"This is the current range of the Deltans. I've excluded the old village, since they no longer live there \u2014 \"", 
          "Marvin bobbed his head in acknowledgement. \"Anyway, I've been doing a lot of digging \u2014 literally, in some cases \u2014 and I've arrived at a reasonable estimate of Deltan population movements over time.\"", 
          "\"They do not appear to be from this area at all. It looks as though the sentient Deltan subspecies originated here\u2026\" Marvin rotated the globe and pointed to a different part of the continent. \"\u2026and moved from there to the current location.\"", 
          "\"Then fled the more dangerous area to set up in an even more dangerous area.\" Marvin shook his head in confusion. \"They aren't morons. They may be just in the process of becoming human-level sentient, but they have common sense. We're missing something.\"", 
          "I shrugged, and sent the globe spinning with a flick of a finger. \"It's a mystery, Marvin, and we do love a mystery.\" We exchanged grins. After all, Bob. \"But the important thing is that they're much safer here, compared to where we found them. They've settled in nicely in Camelot, the hunting's good, and the gorilloids are beginning to get the hint and have pretty much stopped trying to pick off Deltans.\"", 
          "\"You're really going to call their village Camelot?\" Marvin gave me the stink-eye. \"Every time you say it, I hear Knights of the Round Table.\"", 
          "Marvin rolled his eyes and stopped the globe. \"Anyway, I'll keep at this, but we're at a disadvantage here. On Earth, scientists were building up from existing knowledge of a world they understood. On Eden, we're starting from scratch.\"",

He walked in silence for a few more moments. \"Arnold is happy with the new village, uh, Camelot?\" I had mentioned my name for the camp once, without running it through the translator. Archimedes was trying to render the word phonetically. It was a valiant attempt, but no human would have recognized the sound.",

          "Archimedes shrugged. He'd been dealing with that level of conservatism his whole life. It was a constant source of amusement to him that I was surprised by the attitude.", 
          "We endured a few moments of staring as Archimedes came over the crest, the football-sized drone hovering by his shoulder. But I was old news, and the kids soon went back to what they were doing. They appeared to be playing Rinjhaxa, a sort of pick-up-sticks with betting. Again, I was struck by how very human-like these people were. We only had two data points as of yet, but I wondered if there was some universality about the way intelligent species developed and behaved.",

I'd never given her any reason to hate me, as far as I knew. It might be as simple as competition for Archimedes' attention.",

          "Archimedes gestured towards the mountains in the distance. Most of them were high enough to have snow year-round. \"That's a big journey. It was hard with you leading us back here, when we knew what we were heading for. It must have been harder when our parents and their parents were going the other way and had no idea what they'd find.\"",

          "\"It's complicated, Archimedes. I'm not flesh and blood, like you. Each brother I make is a copy of me, with my memories and everything. But usually a little different in personality. Marvin is more cautious than me and tends to keep me from implementing wild plans.\"",

The things seem to be centered on a rookery out on this island\u2026\" Marvin pointed to a large island a kilometer or two offshore. Obviously volcanic in origin, it was steep, deeply folded, and very probably had a lot of lava tubes that would make perfect homes for large flying things.", 
          "\"Can't tell for sure.\" Marvin shrugged. \"They're always coming and going during the day, but unless I start tagging them, I don't know how many nests or dens or whatever are in those caves. But certainly scores of adults, at minimum.\"",

They spend most of their down-time basking on the beach, and they hunt in the water. They're a little more mobile than seals or sea-lions, but still basically sitting ducks on land. Although I'd imagine they could do some damage with those tusks.\"",

          "\"And then we, and by we I mean you, led them back to the flint site. Where they are, once again, on the menu.\" Marvin gazed at me with one eyebrow raised. \"So what now?\"", 
          "I sat down, called up coffee, and leaned back in thought. \"I think we can agree that just doing nothing is off the table?\" Marvin nodded and I continued, \"Likewise, asking the Deltans to move again is probably a non-starter. I doubt they'd do it even if I had a good, safe destination in mind.\"", 
          "\"Don't overdo it,\" Marvin cautioned. \"Let's find out what the animal is capable of. We know we can get it if we throw enough busters at it. Let's find out what \u2018enough' means.\"", 
          "\"I didn't like that,\" Marvin said. \"We got it with the second one, but it was close. I think if we want to take them out dependably, we should go with an encirclement using three or more busters.\"",

He made announcements, he visited villages, but no one was interested or wanted to change. So he grew some himself and passed a law that potatoes were just for leaders, and villagers weren't allowed to eat them. Within a couple of hands of days, all his potatoes had been stolen and people were growing them.\" I watched Archimedes, trying to guess if he'd got the point.",

But the point\u2026\" I glared at him, but of course he couldn't see that. \"\u2026is that he got people to do something by telling them that they couldn't.

The image hovering in my line of sight showed my location, and the location of Archimedes relative to me. I turned to line him up, and began to walk.",

But Archimedes had seen enough new knowledge in his lifetime to understand that when you went from not knowing something to knowing something, it changed the way you lived.", 
          "With the loss of that awe had come a much deeper friendship, and a better understanding between us. Archimedes thought a lot of the things humans took for granted were hilarious. Like the idea of rules for everything. Deltans simply wouldn't stand for such regimentation of their lives.", 
          "As we walked across the land bridge, I looked ahead at the village proper. It was a sea of Deltans, in groups around the central fires, and smaller groups around individual fire-pits. I could see Archimedes' point. No one would be able to keep track of this many people. Really, based on the old definition of a village where everyone knew everyone else, this could be thought of as an unhealthy development. Caerleon wasn't much better. I wondered if the Deltans had a higher tolerance for crowding, or if they had developed a reluctance to split off villages because of the gorilloid and hippogriff threats. I resolved to bring it up with Archimedes when time permitted.", 
          "We moved toward Archimedes' hexghi. There I saw Diana, Buster, Belinda, and a couple of generations of children around the fire. Buster's siblings had long since moved on to their own firepits, but Buster had stayed close with his father. I was glad of that.", 
          "We sat down at the fire, and Archimedes introduced me to the adults using a common Deltan name, which I instructed the translation routine to render as Robert. I performed the proper ear-waggle greeting to each. Diana didn't even twitch, and I relaxed.", 
          "I noted that Diana was looking old and frail. It confirmed my feeling that Archimedes was aging more slowly than average. Probably the same gene responsible for his increased intelligence was affecting his lifespan. I felt a moment of relief that she might be gone soon, then a spike of shame at the thought. I might not like her, but she was Archimedes' life mate, and he was my friend."
